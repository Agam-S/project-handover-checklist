# project-handover-checklist

## Handover

When new people come to project, people replaced in project, or project moved to another team - good handover should be made.
Why?
* Reduce handover time.
* Make clear for everyone how handover will affect schedules/communication/budget.
* Reduce risks of post-handover work.
* Ensure good confidence for new members.


Handover in not a task and is not instant. Handover is always a project. And it should be planned and executed like a project. 

### How to use this template

It could be used in physical or digital way:

#### Physical

Print lists on paper and check them when they are done.

#### Digital (fork)

Fork this project and then edit source to mark completed issues with '[x]'
E.g.
- [x] read this
- [ ] fork project
- [ ] plan and do handover
- [ ] PROFIT!

#### Digital (copy to issue tracker)

Create project in issue tracker and add tasks.
