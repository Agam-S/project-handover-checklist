# project-handover-checklist (DRAFT)

## Handover

When new people come to project, or especially people replaced in project for any reason, good handover should be made.
Why?
* Reduce handover time.
* Make clear for us and customer how handover will affect schedules/communication/budget.
* Reduce risks of post-handover work.
* Ensure good confidence for new members.


Handover in not a task and is not instant. Handover is always a project. And it should be planned and executed like a project.

### How to use

It could be used in few ways:

#### Physical

Print lists on paper and check them when it is done.

#### Digital

Fork this project and then edit source to mark completed issues with '[x]'
E.g.
- [x] read this
- [ ] fork project
- [ ] ?????????
- [ ] PROFIT!


### Checklists

[Handover completeness](cl-completeness.md) - Used to verify if handover was successful.
